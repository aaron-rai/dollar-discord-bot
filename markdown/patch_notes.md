Dollar 1.1.2 aims to eliminate additional pesky bugs to enhance the user experience and create a smoother software version. As we progress towards more stable iterations of 1.1, we encourage users to share their feature requests using `/featurerequest`. Your ideas are valuable to us!

*New Features*:
`!nowplaying` - Reworked command to display a prettier message to show the current playing song. Now we use the Genius API to show the current playing song, its artist and a thumbnail of the songs artwork.

**Fixes:**
- Fix to MySQL connection timing out, last attempt at a validation query would cause Dollar's terminal to freeze due to threads not being cleaned up. Refactored to use tasks.loop rather than manually creating a thread. Tasks.loop run in the background of the main event thread and is essentially the same creating a thread for this task.
- Fix to Event permissions, now users are granted access to ShowsðŸ“º by default. If you create and start an event, 'interested' users will be given access to join the channel when the event starts, while restricting access for everone who is 'uninterested'

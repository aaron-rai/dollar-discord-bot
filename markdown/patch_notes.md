- 2.0.2 fixes some minor annoyances and updates some documentation, if you notice any issues please report them or missing documentation please report it using the `/reportbug` command as we are trying to make Dollar as stable as possible.

### Fixes and Enhancements

- Updated Youtube-Source plugin to 1.11.4
- Added deployment status to the deployment page in github
- Added documentation for game/software update notifiations[Dollar Docs](https://aaronrai24.github.io/DollarDiscordBot/docs/Notifications/overview)
- Fixed an issue with `Poke User`, now Dollar checks if the poked user was already in the same voice channel as the user who poked them. If they were, the bot will not send a message to the user who was poked.
- Added a channel message to the `Poke User` command for visibility to other users in the channel that a user was poked.

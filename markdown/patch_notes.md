Dollar 1.1.4 represents a significant cleanup effort, addressing lingering issues from its earlier, smaller-scale iterations. We are thrilled to announce that a major update is in the works, bringing with it exciting new features.

## Roadmap Highlights

Our future plans include a deeper integration with the Spotipy API, opening up new possibilities for Dollar's functionality. In the upcoming update, our goal is to elevate Dollar beyond being just Cash's personal assistant to a tool that caters to everyone's needs. Imagine automating daily tasks such as checking scores, monitoring the weather, and estimating commute times for work.

Stay tuned for Dollar 2.0 and the transformative enhancements that await!

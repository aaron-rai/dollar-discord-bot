# `/reportbug`

The `/reportbug` command allows users to report any bugs or issues they encounter while using Dollar. This command helps the development team quickly identify and resolve problems, ensuring a smooth and reliable experience for all users.

## Purpose

- The `/reportbug` command is designed to streamline the bug-reporting process. It enables users to notify the development team of any issues, such as bugs, errors, or unexpected behavior.
- This command ensures that bugs are reported in a consistent format, making it easier for developers to understand and address the issue.

## How It Works

When the `/reportbug` command is used, a **modal** is presented to the user, prompting them to provide details about the bug:
- **Bug Description**: A detailed explanation of the bug, including the steps that led to the issue and any specific error messages encountered.
- **Additional Information**: Users can include extra context, such as the actions they were performing at the time, the environment (e.g., server or client), and any other relevant details.

Once the user submits the bug report, it is sent to the development team for review and action. This structured approach helps ensure that bug reports are clear and complete, making it easier for developers to troubleshoot and fix the issue.

### Usage

```bash

# `/status`

The `/status` command provides users with real-time information about the current status of the server running Dollar. It displays vital metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and uptime, allowing users to monitor the health and performance of the bot.

## Purpose
- The `/status` command is designed to offer users a quick and accessible overview of the bot's server health, ensuring transparency and providing insight into how the bot is performing.
- This command helps users identify potential issues with server performance, such as high CPU or memory usage, and can also serve as a diagnostic tool if the bot experiences lag or downtime.

## How It Works
When the `/status` command is issued, Dollar retrieves information about the bot’s server and displays the following metrics:
- **CPU Usage**: The percentage of the server's CPU that is currently being used by the bot.
- **Memory Usage**: The amount of memory (RAM) being utilized by the bot.
- **Uptime**: The duration since the bot was last started or rebooted, indicating how long the bot has been running without interruptions.

This information is displayed in a clear, easy-to-read format, allowing users to quickly assess the current state of the bot’s server.

### Usage
To use the `/status` command:

```bash
/status
```

### Important Notes
- The `/status` command is available to all users who wish to check the server status of Dollar.
- Users can monitor the CPU and memory usage to ensure the bot is running smoothly and efficiently.
- The uptime metric provides insight into how long the bot has been active, which can be useful for tracking performance over time.
- If users notice unusually high CPU or memory usage, they may want to investigate further or contact the bot's developers for assistance.
- The `/status` command is a valuable tool for both users and developers to assess the health and performance of the bot's server.
- Regularly checking the server status can help identify potential issues early and ensure the bot continues to operate optimally.

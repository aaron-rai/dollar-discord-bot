# `/embedcreator`

The `/embedcreator` command allows users to easily create customized embed messages that can be sent to Discord channels. With this command, users can set various embed parameters, such as the title, description, thumbnail, and footer, allowing for rich and visually appealing messages that enhance user engagement.

## Purpose

- The `/embedcreator` command is designed to streamline the process of creating and sending embeds within Discord. This is particularly useful for creating announcements, custom notifications, or other structured messages.
- By using this command, users can craft visually appealing embeds without needing to write complex code or use external tools, making it easy to create professional-looking messages.

## How It Works

When the `/embedcreator` command is invoked, a **modal** will appear where users can input the necessary details to create an embed:
- **Title**: The main heading or title of the embed.
- **Description**: A detailed explanation or content to display in the embed's main body.
- **Thumbnail**: A small image that appears at the top-right corner of the embed for additional context or decoration.
- **Footer**: A footer message that appears at the bottom of the embed, often used for additional information or credits.

Once the user fills in the fields and confirms the creation, Dollar will generate the embed and send it to the designated channel.

### Usage

```bash
/embedcreator
```

### Important Notes

- The `/embedcreator` command is available to all users with the necessary permissions to send messages in the designated channel.
- Users should ensure that the content of the embed complies with Discord's guidelines and the rules of the server.

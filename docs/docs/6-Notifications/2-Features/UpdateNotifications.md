# Update Notifications

Dollar provides a feature that allows you to receive notifications when a new version of a game or software is released. This feature is useful for staying up-to-date with the latest changes and improvements to your favorite applications.

## Purpose

- Keep track of new updates for games and software.
- Receive notifications when new versions are released.

## How It Works

When you enable update notifications for a game or software:
1. **Dollar** watches the `patches` channel only available in the official Dollar Discord server(mfDiscord).
2. When a new update is released, Dollar creates a thread on that specific game/software update in the same `patches` channel.
3. Dollar then `@mentions` the users who have enabled notifications for that game/software.

## Usage

## Enabling Update Notifications

To enable update notifications for a game or software:
1. Navigate to the `patches` channel in the official Dollar Discord server.
2. Find an embed message for the game/software you want to receive notifications for.
3. Click the `ðŸ””` reaction to enable notifications for that game/software.

### Example

- **Scenario**: User "Alex" wants to receive notifications for updates on "Game X."
- **Action**: Alex navigates to the `patches` channel and clicks the `ðŸ””` reaction on the "Game X" message.
- **Outcome**: Alex receives a notification whenever a new update for "Game X" is released.

## Disabling Update Notifications

1. Navigate to the `patches` channel in the official Dollar Discord server.
2. Find the embed message for the game/software you want to disable notifications for.
3. Click the `ðŸ”•` reaction to disable notifications for that game/software.

### Example

## Important Notes

- Update notifications are only available for games and software that have been set up in the `patches` channel available in the official Dollar Discord server.
- You can enable or disable notifications for individual games/software based on your preferences.
- Notifications are sent via `@mentions` in the `patches` channel to alert users of new updates.


The **Update Notifications** feature is a convenient way to stay informed about the latest changes and improvements in your favorite games and software. By enabling notifications, you can ensure that you are always up-to-date with the latest releases.

- If a game you are interested in is not available in the `patches` channel, you can request it to be added by contacting the Dollar support team.

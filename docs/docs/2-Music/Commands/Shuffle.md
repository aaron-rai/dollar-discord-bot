# `!shuffle`

The `!shuffle` command allows users to **randomize the order** of the songs in the current music queue. It provides a way to mix up the playback, ensuring that songs are played in a random order rather than the order they were added to the queue.

## Purpose
- The `!shuffle` command is designed to **randomize the queue** of songs that are scheduled to play.
- This command is useful for users who want to experience a more unpredictable and diverse listening experience by reshuffling the queue of songs.

## How It Works
When you issue the `!shuffle` command, **Dollar** shuffles the songs currently in the queue. The bot rearranges the order of the songs so that they play in a random sequence, rather than following the order they were added to the queue.

- **Dollar** randomizes the order of the songs in the queue.
- The bot then starts playing the songs in the newly shuffled order.
- This command only affects the queue and does not impact the song that is currently playing. The current song will continue playing, and once it finishes, the shuffled queue will be used for subsequent tracks.

### Usage

```bash
!shuffle
```

### Important Notes

- The `!shuffle` command does not remove any songs from the queue. It only changes the order in which the songs are played.
- The shuffle order is random and cannot be customized or controlled by the user.
- The `!shuffle` command is a fun way to mix up your listening experience and discover new songs in your queue.
